# OSCP-Exam-Report-Template

This is the template I used for my OSCP exam.
I modified the original version of Offensive security which you can find here:

- [Original template was created by Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-online/PWKv1-REPORT.doc)

I created a different structure under each host:
- Service Enumeration
- FootHold
- Getting Reverse Shell
- Getting User: local.txt
- Privilege Escalation
- Getting Root: proof.txt
- Vulnerability Fix and Severity
- Proof of Concept Code

In the final part, I have inserted a table where to insert all the local.txt and proof.txt taken.
